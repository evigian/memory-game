## About

The Memory or Matching Game is the third project for the Google Frond-End Developers Nanodegree at Udacity.
The purpose of this project is to put together our knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to create an interactive game with complex features. The game is consisted of a deck with sixteen cards and a score panel which includes moves counter, timer, star rating and restart icon.

## How to play the game

When the user clicks on a card it flips over and shows a symbol. The goal is to locate the symbols that match and uncover all the matching pairs. Try to finish the game the sooner is possible in order to gain more stars! The live game is here: 

## Dependencies

The starter code for the game was provided by Udacity.
