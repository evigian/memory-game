## About

The Memory or Matching Game is the third project for the Google Frond-End Developers Nanodegree at Udacity.
The purpose of this project is to put together our knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to create an interactive game with complex features. The game is consisted of a deck with sixteen cards and a score panel which includes moves counter, timer, star rating and restart icon.

## How to play the game

When the user clicks on a card it flips over and shows a symbol. The goal is to locate the symbols that match and uncover all the matching pairs. Try to finish the game the sooner is possible in order to gain more stars! At the end of the game a modal appears and lets you know in how much time, with how many moves and how many stars you made it! The live game is here: https://evigian.github.io/memory-game-project/

## Dependencies

The starter code for the game, (HTML, CSS and shuffle function), was provided by Udacity. In order to make it interactive, it was necessary to make some changes on HTML and CSS files and then manipulate the DOM using Javascript. Additional changes were made finally on the styling. A great thank you to all the Udacity students and instructors and their wonderful, supportive community who helped with their knowledge to finish this project.
